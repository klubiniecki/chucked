### Add Chuck Norris fun to your code!

*There is no theory of evolution, just a list of creatures Chuck Norris allows to live.*

*The reason the Holy Grail has never been recovered is because nobody is brave enough to ask Chuck Norris to give up his favourite coffee mug.*

**If you find this funny, why not surprise your fellow coders with some Chuck Norris fun?**

### Installation ðŸ‘Š

```
yarn add chucked
```
or
```
npm i chucked
